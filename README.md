# arduino-led-eyes
LED Googles using an Arduino.   Specifically written for an Adafruit Trinket Pro.

This is to run a manually created LED light ring with 8 lights per eye.  
The Left and Right eyes are linked, so each each lit LED is the same in both eyes.
Button cycles through modes.

A blog describing this project will be forthcoming.  I'll add the link here when written.
